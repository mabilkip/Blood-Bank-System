                   Since the institution of blood banking, safety for both blood donors and blood recipients is being 
                   continually and significantly improved. Because a safe, reliable source of blood is critical to providing
                   effective blood products to recipients, blood banks are dependent on the altruistic voluntary donations 
                   of citizens. We provide a platform where anyone who wants to donate blood can be connected to anyone who 
                   needs blood. We also manage all the blood in stock and make sure it is properly handled, stored and 
                   distributed.
                   <br><br>
                   High levels of communication with our members ensures high quality assessment, diagnosis and treatment. 
                   We ensure all blood get the extra care of our multi-disciplinary team. We are committed to ensuring proper 
                   management of blood from donation to transfusion.
